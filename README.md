## Zen game

### an experimental relaxing and motivational text and sound game

Created with [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) by [GalaxyKate](http://www.galaxykate.com/) and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).

This is a WIP and an experimentation with procedural sound generation and text generation using grammar.
We will update the code and add documentation.
